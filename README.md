# Sequences.py v.1.0
This is a repository conatining a range of functions for sequences made with Python. Feel free to use it for your own use. I will be updating it regularly, hopefully with all the code in one at some stage in the future.

**THIS IS ALL MY WORK AND HAS NOT BEEN PILFERED FROM ANYWHERE**

Queries, ideas and requests to merge my work with your versions go [here](https://github.com/M-Python13/Sequences.py/pulls). Issues you may have with any of the programs go [here](https://github.com/M-Python13/Sequences.py/issues).
