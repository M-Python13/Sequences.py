# Sequences.py v.1.3.0
This is a repository conatining a range of functions for sequences made with Python. Feel free to use it for your own use. I will be updating it regularly, hopefully with all the code in one at some stage in the future.

**THIS IS ALL MY WORK AND HAS NOT BEEN PILFERED FROM ANYWHERE**

Queries or ideas with the code already updated or requests to merge my code with your version with your versions go [here](https://github.com/M-Python13/Sequences.py/pulls). Issues, queries or ideas without any code modifications you may have with any of the programs go [here](https://github.com/M-Python13/Sequences.py/issues).
